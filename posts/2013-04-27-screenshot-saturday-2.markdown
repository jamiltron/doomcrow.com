Spent a few hours today working with one
of my buddies on the tools for our next game.

This is pretty much supposed to be a (very limited) replication
of something like [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org), only extremely
specific for our kind of game, and without much of a ui. Pretty much
its just so we can pump out hex maps quicker than actually editing 
a text file.
