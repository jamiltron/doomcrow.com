I have been really busy recently, so I wanted to provide a tangible update.
Here is the 'beta' desktop version of Homunculus. This has been tested pretty
much as I have been coding, but I thought a good part of building up the
mobile version would be to have more people playing the desktop version, as 
a lot of the game (sans interface) will be the same.

Let me know about any bugs, and I hope you enjoy it. The Windows version should
be executable via double-click. The Linux/OSX require a Java Runtime Environmet, and should be runnable via command-line using:

``java -jar Homunculus.jar``
